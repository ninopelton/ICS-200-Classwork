                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I'm a student at Hawaii Community College with a passion for web development. My journey into the world of coding started with a simple curiosity and a desire to learn more about technology.</p>
                <p>I've pursued both formal education in web development and engaged in self-directed learning. Through formal coursework and independent exploration, I've honed my skills in areas such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design. This combination of structured learning and self-teaching has provided me with a well-rounded understanding of web development, allowing me to continually expand my knowledge and adapt to evolving technologies.</p>
                <p>Currently, I'm pursuing my studies at Hawaii Community College, where I'm studying web development. My coursework introduces various aspects of web page authoring, including client-side web page creation using web authoring languages and style sheets. Throughout my studies, I've gained experience in utilizing graphical design elements, ensuring validation, ensuring browser compatibility, and enhancing accessibility in web development projects. Additionally, I've learned how to incorporate dynamic elements into web pages using scripting languages, including client-side scripting, event handling, input validation, selection, repetition, and parameter passing.</p>
                <p>I'm passionate about applying these skills to create engaging and user-friendly web experiences, and I'm excited to continue learning and growing in the field of web development.</p>
                <p>When I'm not studying or coding, you can find me soaking up the sun on Hawaii's beautiful beaches, exploring local hikes, or enjoying the rich cultural experiences that the islands have to offer.</p>
